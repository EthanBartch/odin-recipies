<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Easy to prepare - sure to please. Great dish for guests when you have little time (or desire) to slave all day in the kitchen.Sea bass is a white fish that has a mild delicate flavor with a subtle sweetness that is similar to grouper or cod. The flesh is moist, buttery, and tender, with firm medium-sized flakes like haddock. Sea bass is an excellent choice for people with a sensitive palate that don't enjoy “fishy tasting” seafood.</p>
